Flow analysis of a spinning shuttlecock using CFD

Hello, I am Mridul Nambiar, UG in dept. of Aerospace Er., IIT Kanpur. This was my first research project as a student of IIT-Kanpur. I had taken this project in my sophomore year under Prof. Sanjay Mittal, dept. of Aerospace Er.

## Objectives
- Generating a mesh designed for simulating a spinning shuttlecock.
- Studying various approaches for solving a spinning shuttlecock.
- Investigating the drag on the shuttlecock.
- Investigating the auto-rotation speed of the shuttlecock.

## Methodology
- This research used ANSYS Fluent software, which is a widely used CFD software, to simulate the flow around a spinning shuttlecock.
- An existing model of a shuttlecock was optimized to decrease computational time, without affecting accuracy in results.
- Techniques like mesh motion and frame motion were used to accurately simulate the rotation of the shuttlecock.
- These techniques were validated by running simulations of flow across a 2D rotating cylinder.
- The unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) equations were solved for the fluid flow using the turbulence model k-e numerically.
- The simulation results were analysed and used to calculate the drag coefficient, moments, and auto-rotation speed of the shuttlecock.
